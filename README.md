Our mission focus for this trimester is education, and our project is a student academic manager. This project will help students track how well they are doing at school. The document's purpose is to describe the functional requirements of the student academic manager. At the beginning of the term, students will set the marks they want to achieve at the end of the term, and the system will calculate the score they need to get in each subject to achieve their goal. During the term, students will input the scores of each subject, and the system will tell them if they are either on track to achieve their goal or falling behind. The system will also suggest strategies they need to use for improvement
