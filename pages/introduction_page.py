This project will help students track how well they are doing at school. 
At the beginning of the term, students will set the marks they want to achieve 
at the end of the term, and the system will calculate the score they need to get 
in each subject to achieve their goal. During the term, students will input the 
scores of each subject, and the system will tell them if they are either on track 
to achieve their goal or falling behind. The system will also suggest strategies 
they need to use for improvement
